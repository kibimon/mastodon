Monstodon is an implementation of [ActivityMon](https://gist.github.com/marrus-sh/b964a9c98cec9b8e306afe4834472732) on top of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon).
It is a **free, open-source social network server** based on **open web protocols** like ActivityPub and OStatusâ€”only with support for cute monsters as well :3

**Ruby on Rails** is used for the back-end, while **React.js** and Redux are used for the dynamic front-end. A static front-end for public resources (profiles and statuses) is also provided.

## Monstodon Features

**Support for cute, federated mon :3**

Who doesn't want a cute mon or several on your ActivityPub profile???

## Mastodon Features

**No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform**

It doesn't have to be Mastodon, whatever implements ActivityPub or OStatus is part of the social network!

**Real-time timeline updates**

See the updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

**Federated thread resolving**

If someone you follow replies to a user unknown to the server, the server fetches the full thread so you can view it without leaving the UI

**Media attachments like images and short videos**

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos are looped - like vines!

**OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API**

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider so 3rd party apps can use the API

**Fast response times**

Mastodon tries to be as fast and responsive as possible, so all long-running tasks are delegated to background processing

**Deployable via Docker**

You don't need to mess with dependencies and configuration if you want to try Mastodon, if you have Docker and Docker Compose the deployment is extremely easy
